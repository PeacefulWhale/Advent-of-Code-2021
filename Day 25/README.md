# Advent of Code Day 25

Oh my, that is far more sea cucumbers than I expected.

I can't squish them, for some reason they all have googly eyes and I would feel terrible if I crushed them.

Maybe I can find a place to set down where there won't be any wiggling sea cucumber friends. I only have to wait for them to stop squiggling after all!

Aha! The keys! They're close!

The stars I've been collecting on my way down, they should be able to boost the remote key sensor signal! It's working!

The keys! They've been found!

Now I can slowly make my way back up, and pray that nothing else explodes.

## **Code Writeup**

This was pretty straight forward. I just wrote a simple simulation for the sea cucumbers and ran it until there wasn't anything moving.

To be honest, I'm not sure what sort of optimizations one would make for something like this. It seems to be the sort of problem that just has to be simulated.
